# DreamFolks Airport Services Machine Learning Project

## Overview

DreamFolks is a global travel and lifestyle services aggregator. It provides a wide range of travel and lifestyle services, including airport transfers, lounge access, golf privileges, and wellness services. It also offers exclusive travel and lifestyle benefit programs tailored to suit businesses.

## Lounge Facilities Classification Problem

This project focuses on the Lounge Facilities Classification problem, where the goal is to predict or classify the type of lounge services available at different airports based on various features. These features include airport characteristics, customer demographics, and available services such as lounge access, wellness services, and transfer services.

### Key Features in the Dataset:
- **Airport**: Name or code of the airport.
- **Lounge Access Points**: Type or number of access points for lounges.
- **Transfer Services**: Availability of airport transfer services.
- **Wellness Services**: Whether wellness services are available at the lounge.
- **Golf Privileges**: Access to golf or leisure privileges.
- **Customer Demographics**: Age, income, travel frequency.
- **Service Availability**: Availability of services depending on factors like time of day or season.

### Steps for the Project:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Gather relevant data from DreamFolks services.
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical values.

2. **Feature Engineering and Selection**:
   - Perform feature importance analysis to select key features.
   - Create new features based on domain knowledge such as customer preferences and airport characteristics.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Train various classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).
   - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Tune the model hyperparameters using Grid Search or Random Search to optimize performance.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the trained model into a Flask or Django web application.
   - Allow users to input airport details and travel preferences to predict the available lounge services.

6. **Monitoring and Updates**:
   - Continuously monitor the model's performance in production and retrain with updated data to maintain accuracy.

## Technologies Used:
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Flask/Django for model deployment
- Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and analysis

## Conclusion:
This project aims to create an effective machine learning model that can help DreamFolks predict the best lounge services available to travelers based on a set of features.
